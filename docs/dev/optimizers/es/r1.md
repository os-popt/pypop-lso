## Open-Source Implementation

## Algorithmic Features

Although its basic algorithmic framework is still based on the well-designed CMA-ES, R1-ES has some obvious advantages over CMA-ES (e.g., computationally much more efficient sampling and covariance matrix approximating/updating) especially for large-scale, black-box optimization. The core idea of R1-ES is to use a *sparse plus low-rank* sampling model with linear computational complexity (rather than the *full covariance-matrix* one with quadratic computational complexity) to capture the promising/principal search direction.
