## Open-Source Implementation

Its source code is openly available at the class [RankOne](https://github.com/os-popt/pypop-lso/blob/master/optimizers/es/r1.py).

*For practical purpose*, we suggest to use its **re-start** version (i.e., the class [RestartRankOne](https://github.com/os-popt/pypop-lso/blob/master/optimizers/es/rr1.py)) for possibly high-quality optimization results for large-scale black-box optimization. Here we include it just *for research purpose* (i.e., for theoretical investigation or for empirical benchmarking).

## Input Arguments

Specific input arguments:

* ```step_size```: initial global step-size (also called mutation strength) for sampling distribution.
  * Float scalar value larger than 0,
  * If not set, raise a ValueError,
  * Only support isotropic Gaussian sampling distribution during initialization and will be adapted automatically during optimization.

## Algorithmic Features

Although its basic algorithmic framework is still based on the well-designed CMA-ES, R1-ES has some obvious advantages over CMA-ES (e.g., computationally much more efficient sampling and covariance matrix approximating/updating) especially for large-scale, black-box optimization. The core idea of R1-ES is to use a *sparse plus low-rank* sampling model with linear computational complexity (rather than the *full covariance-matrix* one with quadratic computational complexity) to capture the promising/principal search direction.
